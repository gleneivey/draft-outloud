## This is Draft Outloud ##

Draft Outloud is a Ruby-on-Rails web application for hosting the draft
of a book while it is being written.

The project is hosted on GitHub at:

    https://github.com/gleneivey/draft-outloud

Documentation is located in its GitHub wiki, and bug reporting uses
GitHub Issues.  The development roadmap is located in Pivotal Tracker

## Structure of a Draft book ##

Draft Outload displays books written using the DocBook XML markup.  It
fetches the content for the book from a git repository, processes it
using style sheets from the same repository into HTML for display and
PDF for download.  The HTML is displayed using a combination of the
CSS built into Draft Outloud and included in the git repository along
with the book's content.

The repository also contains metadata about the book specifically for
display in the Draft Outloud web application, including custom home
page content, headers, and footers.
